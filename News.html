                        If you passed your car driving test from 1 January 1997 to 18 January 2013, you can currently drive either of the following:<br><br><br>

                        You’ve had to pass a car and trailer driving test if you want to tow anything heavier.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Licences issued from 19 January 2013</h3>

            <h1>What will change later in 2021?</h1>
                    <p>If you passed your car driving test from 1 January 1997, you’ll be allowed to tow trailers up to 3,500kg MAM when the law changes.<br>
                        The DVLA will update your driving licence record to show that you’re allowed to tow trailers. You’ll get category BE added to your driving licence when you get a new photocard driving licence.<br><br>
                        You do not need to contact DVLA for this to happen. It will be done automatically.

                    <p>Car and trailer driving tests are stopping before the law changes.</p>
                    <p>You can no longer book or take a car and trailer driving test from 20 September 2021. However, the law will not change until later in 2021.</p>
            
            <h1>What you can do until the law changes</h1>
                    <p>
                        Until the law changes later in autumn 2021, you must continue to follow the current rules about what you’re allowed to tow based on when you passed your car driving test.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="fine">You can be fined up to £1,000, be banned from driving and get up to 6 penalty points on your driving licence if you tow anything heavier before the law changes.</h3>
                    <p>
                        You’re only allowed to tow anything heavier if you’re being supervised. When you’re being supervised, you must:<br><br><br>

                <h2>Driving a car and trailer for the first time</h2>

                    <p>
                        It’s best to take training from a driving instructor if you want to start driving a car and trailer.

                        The ‘National standard for driving cars and light vans’ tells you about the skills, knowledge and understanding you need to tow a trailer or caravan.
                    </p>

                <h2>If you’d booked a car and trailer driving test</h2>

                    <p>
                        Your car and trailer driving test will not go ahead if it was due to take place on or after 20 September 2021.

                        If you booked the test yourself, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency has automatically cancelled it for you. You’ll get a full refund within 5 working days.

                        If your driving instructor booked your test for you, talk to them about what happens next.

                        You cannot get a refund or compensation for any training that you’ve taken to help you prepare to take the test.
                    </p>

                <h2>If you had previously passed a car and trailer driving test</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        You cannot get a refund or compensation for any training that you took to help you prepare to take a car and trailer driving test.<br><br>

                        You also cannot get a refund for any tests you took.
